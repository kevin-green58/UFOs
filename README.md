# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to create a web application that can be used to easily filter through supposed UFO sightings in January 2010. This was accomplished using a Javascript d3 framework. 

## Results
The webpage is fairly straight forward to navigate. Using the ` d3.selectAll("input").on("change", updateFilters);` functionality, one simply needs to type something into one of the five filters on the left side of the page. After pressing `Enter ` , the results will filter to only show results that have a match for that category. Results can be narrowed down further using multiple filters.
